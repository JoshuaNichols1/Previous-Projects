                        <p class="montserrat">Pokemon (Japanese for Pocket Monster) is a Game Company created in Japan which creates video games, movies and card games based in the Pokemon Universe. The Pokemon universe is a earth where monsters with power and humans live together, and trainers use the monsters as pets and weapons against other trainers and criminals. Most games in the Pokemon Universe are based on the player being a trainer who needs to fight bad people and protect the weaker Pokemon.</p>
						<h1 class="text-white">Card Game Rules</h1>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h2 class="text-white">The Setup</h2>
						<p class="montserrat">Each player assembles a deck of 60 of his own card. Then each player draws seven cards from her deck to start the game.</p>
						<h2 class="text-white">Turns</h2>
						<p class="montserrat">On your turn, you first draw a card from the deck. You can then take steps to increase your attack power. One way is to place Energy cards on the active Pokemon, giving it the energy it needs to fight. You can also place up to five Pokemon on the bench, play a Trainer card to boost the Pokemon and evolve the active Pokemon by placing the correct evolution card on top of it. You can also retreat the active Pokemon to the Bench, but only if the Pokemon had enough energy to attack and if there is a Pokemon on the Bench to replace it. Attacking is the last step of the turn.</p>
						<h2 class="text-white">Attack</h2>
						<p class="montserrat">You don't have to attack on a turn and cannot unless the active Pokemon has the energy for the attack you wish to perform. Declare the type of attack you are using. Pokemon cards have different attacks that not only deal damage to an opponent but can also cause status effects like asleep, confused, paralyzed, poisoned and burned. These effects are removed when a Pokemon retreats or evolves. Your turn ends after the one attack; if you knocked out the opposing Pokemon by dealing enough damage, take one of your opponent's six prize cards. If you get all of your opponent's prize cards (or your opponent can't draw a card on her turn), you win the game.</p>
